# MACHINE LEARNING MODELS IN BANKRUPTCY PREDICTION
This repository includes implementations and analyses used in my Bachelor's thesis: Application of Machine Learning in Bankruptcy Prediction: A Literature Review.\
I have included the models implementation, the auxiliary functions, and my analysis notebook.
## ABSTRACT
Substantial research efforts have focused on the topic of bankruptcy prediction.
Researchers have analyze bankruptcy and default events using various statistical and
machine learning techniques for risk management. Academics have also employed
various data sources and processing techniques. In this thesis, various proposed
models since 2017 in the literature are evaluated and compared. A literature review
is conducted to compare the use of data and processing techniques. The models are
then implemented and compared in a uniform testing environment to determine the
most optimal method. The data from 2009 to 2021 on US firms from the Compustat
database is used for the experiment. Several features sets, both from the literature
and from widely used feature selection methods, are generated and applied in the
experiment to determine the most suitable set of features for predicting bankruptcy.
The experiment results have highlighted several insights in relation to the application
of machine learning models in bankruptcy prediction. The models trained on Altmanâ€™s
original features set outperforms those of the the other sets, including recently proposed
features sets. This may be due to the diverse set of firms in the experiment, which are
from various industries with varying financial conditions. Regarding machine learning
models, ensemble methods, random forest, categorical boosting, and gradient boosted
decision tree, outperform the other techniques in almost every evaluation metric.
Most of the recently proposed methods show lackluster performances compared to
previously employed models. The results encourage future research in a more focused
manner, which focuses on firms in a single field or scope, to avoid introducing noises
and affecting classifying ability. Furthermore, more research on the interpretability of
the models would be beneficial to professionals in the field.
